# Project status

We are currently putting together a proposal for a community process to assemble content for the guide. This process will:

* Establish & ratify the principles and goals for the guide
* Establish an initial list of relevant topics and concerns
* Collect and synthesize guidance from the community

There will be plenty of time & opportunity for all interested parties to participate.

Stay tuned to [the usual Coq community channels](https://vstyle.readthedocs.io/en/latest/project_structure.html#announcements) for an announcement!
